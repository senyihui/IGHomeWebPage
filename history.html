        <p>In late 2011, Invictus Gaming's Dota squad started to transition to Dota 2. The team kept on their roster
            Chen "Zhou" Yao, Jiang "YYF" Cen, Luo "Ferrari 430" Feichi, Wong "Chuan" Hock Chuan and Zeng "Faith" Hongda.
            They became the champions and won the $1,000,000 prize at The International 2012 defeating Natus Vincere in
            four games in a best of five series of the finals.The Grand Finals of The International 2 tournament took
            place in the Seattle, US.</p>

        <p>In the same year, Invictus Gaming's Dota 2 quad became the World Cyber Games 2012 world champions. Since
            Chuan is from Malaysia, the rules of World Cyber Games 2012 restricted him from playing alongside his team
            in the event. Therefore, Invictus Gaming's dota 2 team has found Li "chisbug(CH)" Chen to replace him. It
            was another impressive performance by iG and DK where they finished the group stages with an undefeated
            record. They finally met each other in the finals where Invictus Gaming would end the winning streak of DK
            and later on ending their run with a 2-0 record and take the tournament without dropping a single game.</p>
